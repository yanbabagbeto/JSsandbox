🧑‍🍳 # Here is the algorithm to write decimal integer to hexadecimal converter

- [ ] Divide the number by 16
- [ ] Store the remainder of that division
- [ ] Convert that remainder in hex values
- [ ] Add that remainder to an array
- [ ] Store the quotient of that division in a variable called dividend
- [ ] Verify if the dividend is less than 16
  - [ ] If not, repeat the previous steps
- [ ] Once the dividend is less than or equals to 16, convert the remainder in Hex values and push it to the array.
- [ ] Now revert the array
- [ ] Convert the array to a string and you have you hexadecimal
